Bootcamp number 2 homework assignment

Description: 

This script can be used to analyze a spreadsheet of trading data to summarize the activity by ticker, the change in price over that period, the percentage change over that period, and the total volume of that ticker. 

It will then look at each quarter and identify the tickers with the biggest increase and decrease.  It will return the ticker for those stocks and the volumne for those stocks.  

Challenges:

I was difficult to go through the instructions one step at a time and then start over with the next set of instructions.  I found it challenging to make sure you are putting the code in the right location and loop.  
Part of this challenge was also to keep the variables defined properly.  Moving from sheet to sheet you have to reset many of the variables which requires resetting them in the correct spot. This caused me some issues.  

Uses:

You can use this if you have a stock data in a pretty specific format.  The format must be columns of <ticker>	<date>	<open>	<high>	<low>	<close>	<vol>.  You can have multiple days of data from the same ticker and multiple tickers.  If you have that format this script will work.
